# Job Source Resolver App

a) 
	The stack used for this application was Anguar, ASP.net core api, and sql server. 
   	This was a effective implementation because of familiarity, as time was a factor for this project. 

b)
	 Please refer to job-source-resolver-ui\src\app\upload\job-upload\job-upload.component.ts for the start of the job source resolution logic.

c)
	PrimeNg was used for some UI components. This was used to enhance the speed and asthetics of the application.
	ngx-csv-parser was used to read/parse the excel file. 
	ngx-toaster was used to display information on the application.
